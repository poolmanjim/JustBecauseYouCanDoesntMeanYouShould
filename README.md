# JustBecauseYouCanDoesntMeanYouShould
Proof that just because you can do it in Powershell, doesn't mean you should do it in powershell. This is intended to be intentionally confusing, hard to follow, and more-or-less a headache to try and decihper. To be honest, I'm not sure it is doing 100% of what I want it to do. Enjoy. 

# How-To
This script cannot be run in ISE, ISE doesn't support Unicode fully. Use vscode. 

# Origin
Based around the following Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/g6jfle/construction_progress_space_shuttle_day_4/

# License
Good luck. If your production script uses this, you're insane. I suspect it would be a great addition to world-ending AIs or something we could upload to the alien mothership before detonating a nuke.
